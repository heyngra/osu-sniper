# osu-sniper

Tracking new #1's with a Twitter bot!
# [Installation](/installation.md)

# How does it work?
It uses osu!'s IRC chat to read new messages from #announce. If there's a new message that is a snipe on someone's score, the bot then checks if the user opted out from being tracked. If not, it prepares the image, downloads the replay (and beatmap) and uploads it to twitter.
